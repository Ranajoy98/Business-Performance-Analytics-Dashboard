## Overview
This project presents a set of interactive dashboards designed to analyze sales and customer trends. The dashboards provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, customer distribution, order quantities, and profit margins. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions by identifying trends, top-performing categories, and areas needing improvement.
